# ADR 008: SSI Agents Architecture

## Changelog

- 2021-10-11: Initial draft

## Status

PROPOSED

## Abstract

Cosmos Cash relies on [self-sovereign identity (SSI)](../../Reference/GLOSSARY.md#self-sovereign-identity-ssi) for establishing secure channels of communication between 
actors. In SSI context actors establish secure channels and communicate using software components called agents.  

This document illustrates how SSI agents interacts with each other using Cosmos Cash as a [verifiable data registry (VDR)](../../Reference/GLOSSARY.md#verifiable-data-registry-vdr).
